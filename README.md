Test scenarios and test infrustructure placed in src/test/groovy/apitest package;

Package 'http' represents the rest client;
Package 'common' contains configuration and rest client instantiation in the BaseTest class;

Test scenarios located in the CocktailDbTest.groovy class;

I pick the Spock framework for api tests as it provides data and behavoiur driven approaches in one place
which realy cool. It helps to write less code at the same time providing with a greate amount of test coverage 
and it sharpened for api testing.
