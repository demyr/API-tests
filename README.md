This is a test task performed by me for a QA engineer position.
In this task i should have chose several endpoints, came up with test scenarios against them and implement tests in any language of my preference.

This project performs API tests against the https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

Test scenarios placed in src/test/groovy/apitest package.
Tools for performing request like http cliend placed in src/main/groovy/http package.

I picked the Spock framework for api tests as it provides data and behavoiur driven approaches in one place
which realy cool. It helps to write less code at the same time providing with a greate amount of test coverage 
and it sharpened for api testing.
